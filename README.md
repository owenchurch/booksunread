# books unread

**books unread** is a small iOS app that helps you visualize how much reading you could have done instead of scrolling.

you enter:

- your daily screen time (in hours)
- your reading speed (words per minute)
- the average length of a book (in words)

and the app calculates how many books you *could* have read in that same amount of time.

## features

- simple SwiftUI form-based interface for entering:
  - screen time
  - reading speed
  - average book length
- instant calculation of:
  - total words you could have read
  - approximate number of books
- clean, focused UI to make the result easy to understand

## tech stack

- `Swift`
- `SwiftUI`
- `iOS`
- `Xcode`

## what I learned

- basics of building iOS interfaces with **SwiftUI**
- working with user input and simple calculations
- structuring a small app in Swift (views, state, and logic)

## availability

this app is not on the App Store.

you can run it locally on your own iOS device in developer mode via Xcode if you'd like.
